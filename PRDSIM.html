                <b>Title:</b> Full remote home security - Paradym
                <br>
                <b>Author:</b> Michael Stang<br><br>
                
                
                <b>Overview</b>
                <br><br>
                The home security camera has two main goals, to provide homeowners with peace of mind by monitoring their property and alerting them of any potential security threats. (value that comes from having 24/7 remote access to view property and call for help with an internet connection)
                <br><br>
                This vision will be supported by taking advantage of bringing safety into your home with the power of a smartphone for homeowners and creating a place where safety can be assured.

                <b>Q&A</b><br><br>
                Q: <b>Do I need a security system in a safe neighborhood?</b><br><br>
                A: No matter how safe a neighborhood is, no area is completely immune to crime. In fact, Naperville, Illinois, the safest city in the United States in 2017 based on violent and property crime statistics, still had 1,122 property crimes per 100,000 individuals2.
                <br><br>Property damage is not uncommon in suburban neighborhoods (particularly those with large populations of children and teenagers). According to the Insurance Information Institute, the third most common home insurance claim is for property damage that includes malicious mischief (think egging or vandalism).
                <br><br>
                Q: <b>Is home security monitoring really worth it?</b><br><br>
                A: If you are not at home to hear an alarm, see something on the security cameras, or see any sensors activated, a team of qualified, highly trained home professionals will hear it and respond to ensure your home and family are safe in any situation.
                <br><br>
                In an emergency, Paradym's Smart Home Specialists—our highly trained customer service monitoring team—contacts emergency services on your behalf, often before you have the chance to make the call on your mobile device.

Because monitoring and support are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, our professionals don't miss a beat and frequently detect potential problems and emergency situations before you do.
                <br><br>
                Q: <b>How many home security cameras do I need?</b><br><br>
                A:  The number of security cameras you require is determined by a variety of factors. The first thing you'll need to figure out is why you're using cameras. If you want to use your outdoor cameras to deter burglars, for example, place more cameras in visible locations.
                <br><br>
                If you're using them to keep an eye on your family and pets, you might want to invest in more indoor cameras. Perhaps one for each child's room, or just one that points to your doggy door. You'll need cameras for each of these areas if you want to use them as evidence or keep an eye on valuables.
                <br><br>
                As a general rule, 3-4 in concerned areas are a great start for any home.
                <br><br>
                Q: <b>Where is the best place to mount a camera?</b><br><br>
                A: Security camera placement can’t be emphasized enough. And to get the most safety, control, and security out of your installation, There is planning needed before you start drilling holes.
                <br><br>
                When you’re making those final decisions about where to place your surveillance cameras, remember the back of the home is generally most vulnerable. Any doors and windows in the home can pose a threat. So you’ll want to make sure cameras are covering the following:
                <br><br>
                <li>Doors</li>
                <br>
                Most intruders try to enter a house through either the front or back door. Ideally, all entrances to the home, including the garage door, should be monitored by cameras.
                <br><br>
                <li>Driveway</li>
                <br>
                Installing an outdoor camera in clear view of the driveway and surrounding area can aid in preventing vehicle vandalism, theft, and identifying perpetrators loitering on the street or leaving in a car parked near the driveway.
                Obscure Windows
                Intruders frequently enter homes through windows that are not visible from the street, lowering their chances of being caught. It is highly suggested to point outdoor cameras at these windows.
                <br><br>
                <li>Obscure Windows</li>
                <br>
                Skulkers tend to enter homes through areas out of view from the street, which decreases the chance of being caught. Angle cameras toward these hidden areas.
